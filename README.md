As our final project for Signals and Systems, we were tasked to work in pairs to create a personal project that would allow us to delve deeper into a topic taught in class. My team chose to explore the Fourier Transform and its role in audio engineering, as we both had an interest in music and audio effects. Once we presented the project to our professor to show that it could reasonably be completed, we swapped an incomplete version of our project with one created by another team.
